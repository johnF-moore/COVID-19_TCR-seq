# COVID-19 TCR-seq
Single-cell TCR-seq for peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19

Code to process the sequencing reads is at TRUST_covid_run_041822.sh

Code to identify RNA signatures of potential TCR experimental issues is at RNA_expression_of_overlapping_TCRs.Rmd

Clustering of the single-cell TCR-seq data using TCRdist3 is done in making_a_or_b_metaclonotypes.py

Automated analyses of the TCRdist3 clusters is done using some functions I wrote in analysis_output_1E5_sub2_red1.Rmd
